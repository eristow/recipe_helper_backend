## TODO:

### From https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/:

- [ ] Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/.
- [ ] Add a handler to make the web root redirect to /view/FrontPage.
- [ ] Spruce up the page templates by making them valid HTML and adding some CSS rules.
- [ ] Implement inter-page linking by converting instances of [PageName] to <a href="/view/PageName">PageName</a>. (hint: you could use regexp.ReplaceAllFunc to do this)

### From me:

- [] Switch from storing recipes in files to storing them in a database.
- [] Extract HTML into React front-end
